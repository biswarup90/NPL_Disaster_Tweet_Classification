# NPL_Disaster_Tweet_Classification

**GitHub Project: Kaggle NLP Competition - Disaster Tweet Classification**

**Description:**
Welcome to our GitHub repository for the Kaggle competition on Natural Language Processing (NLP) - [Disaster Tweet Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started)! In this competition, we aim to harness the power of NLP to classify tweets as either related to real disasters or not. This repository contains the code, data preprocessing scripts, and resources we used to tackle this challenge.

**Competition Overview:**
The [Disaster Tweet Classification competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started) tasks participants with developing a machine learning model that can automatically classify tweets as either disaster-related or not. With the proliferation of social media, being able to quickly identify and prioritize disaster-related information is crucial for effective response efforts.

**Our Approach:**
In this repository, we share our approach to solving this problem. We have implemented various NLP techniques, including text preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection, to create a robust and accurate classification model. Our code is well-documented, making it easy for you to understand and reproduce our results.

**Repository Contents:**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Scripts and notebooks for cleaning, tokenizing, and preparing the tweet data for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering:** Code for extracting and creating relevant features from the text data.
- **Model Development:** Implementation of different machine learning and deep learning models for tweet classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Explanation of the evaluation metrics used in this competition and code for computing them.
- **Submission Files:** Templates and scripts for generating Kaggle competition submissions.
- **Requirements:** A list of required libraries and dependencies for running the code.

**Getting Started:**
If you want to explore our work, improve upon it, or use it as a starting point for your own participation in the competition, simply clone this repository and follow the instructions in the README to set up your environment and run the code.

**Contributions and Issues:**
We welcome contributions from the community to improve our model's performance. If you encounter any issues or have ideas for enhancements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.


Best of luck, and happy coding!
