# NPL_Disaster_Tweet_Classification

**GitHub Project: Kaggle NLP Competition - Disaster Tweet Classification**

**Description:**
Welcome to our GitHub repository for the Kaggle competition on Natural Language Processing (NLP) - [Disaster Tweet Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started)! In this competition, we aim to harness the power of NLP to classify tweets as either related to real disasters or not. This repository contains the code, data preprocessing scripts, and resources we used to tackle this challenge.

**Competition Overview:**
The [Disaster Tweet Classification competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started) tasks participants with developing a machine learning model that can automatically classify tweets as either disaster-related or not. With the proliferation of social media, being able to quickly identify and prioritize disaster-related information is crucial for effective response efforts.

**Our Approach:**
The approach has been well documented in the code with useful comments. Please follow that.
